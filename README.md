Resumate
========

This is an intuitive resume builder with minimal and clean UI.


SETTING UP THE DATABASE: simply query your database with ResumateDB.sql (in the php folder).

connect.php (in the php folder) contains the PDO connection config. By default, username is ‘root’ and password is empty. Make sure to change it if your environment is setting differently.
